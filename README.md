# Firebase Initialization Error: Silent Failures

This repository demonstrates a common but subtle error in Firebase applications: failing to properly initialize Firebase before using its services.  This can lead to seemingly random failures or unexpected behavior without clear error messages.

The `bug.js` file shows an example of this error. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with proper initialization handling.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `bug.js`. You'll likely see unexpected behavior or no output depending on your Firebase setup. 
3. Run `bugSolution.js`. This should provide the expected output if Firebase is properly configured. 

## Issue
The main issue lies in attempting to interact with the Firebase database before the `initializeApp` promise resolves, leading to an implicit failure.
